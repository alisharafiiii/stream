# ðŸŽ² Betting Card Footer & Transaction History Fixes

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. **Betting Card Footer Layout**
- **Problem**: Gap between betting card and bottom of screen
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed all margins from `.bettingCard`
  - Made it stick directly to `bottom: 0`
  - Now sits flush at the bottom as a true footer

### 2. **Expanded Section Visibility**
- **Problem**: When purple/blue buttons clicked, expanded section went below viewport
- **Solution**:
  - Changed expanded sections to `position: fixed` 
  - Made them appear ABOVE buttons (`bottom: 100%`)
  - Full width with rounded top corners
  - Always visible when expanded

### 3. **Transaction History Display**
- **Problem**: Transactions not showing on profile page
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed API endpoint to correctly fetch betting history
  - Updated to use proper Redis keys (`REDIS_KEYS.BETTING_HISTORY()`)
  - Added support for current session transactions
  - Fixed payout calculation to match simple 2x formula
  - Import correct `UserBets` type with transactions array

### 4. **Deposit Tracking**
- **Problem**: Deposits not tracked in transaction history
- **Solution**:
  - Updated PUT endpoint in `/api/user` to record deposits
  - Deposits now saved to `user:deposits:{fid}` in Redis
  - Transactions include timestamp and transaction hash

## ðŸ“Š Data Sync Between Admin & Profile

### Admin Panel Shows:
- User balance
- Profile picture
- Username as `basename.eth`
- Link to view full profile

### Profile Page Shows:
- Complete transaction history:
  - âœ… Deposits (with transaction hash)
  - âœ… Withdrawals (with BaseScan link)
  - âœ… Bets (individual transactions)
  - âœ… Payouts (with win/loss status)
- Running statistics:
  - Total deposits
  - Total withdrawals
  - Total bets
  - Total winnings

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Improvements

1. **Better UX**: No gaps, smooth animations, always visible controls
2. **Data Integrity**: All transactions properly tracked and displayed
3. **Consistency**: Admin panel and profile page show same data
4. **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design maintained

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

- Fixed TypeScript imports for `UserBets` interface
