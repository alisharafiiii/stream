# Animation and Receipt Fixes ðŸŽ‰

All the reported issues have been fixed and deployed!

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. âœ… Animations Now Working
**Problem**: Winner/loser animations weren't showing after results
**Solution**: 
- Modified button visibility logic to keep buttons visible when session is resolved
- Buttons now show during all states: open, frozen, and resolved
- Winner button pulses with green glow animation
- Loser button fades to 30% opacity
- Buttons are disabled (non-clickable) when not in 'open' state

### 2. âœ… Balance Updates Automatically
**Problem**: Balance wasn't updating after placing bets
**Solution**:
- Balance updates immediately when bet is placed
- Balance also refreshes after payout is processed
- No manual refresh needed

### 3. âœ… Receipt Shows After Round
**Problem**: Receipt wasn't showing after winner was declared
**Solution**:
- Added state to save user bets even when session is resolved
- Receipt now properly shows with all bet details
- Displays whether you won or lost
- Shows breakdown of winnings, service fee deduction, and total payout
- Works even if betting data is cleared after resolution

### 4. âœ… Fixed 404 Error
**Issue**: You were accessing an old deployment URL
**Current URL**: https://stream-niggw4y4a-nabus-projects-fb6829d6.vercel.app

## How It Works Now:

1. **During Betting (Open)**:
   - Buttons are clickable and expandable
   - Balance updates immediately after each bet

2. **When Frozen**:
   - Buttons visible but disabled
   - Shows "Waiting for results..."

3. **When Resolved**:
   - Buttons show with animations
   - Winner button pulses continuously
   - Loser button fades out
   - Receipt overlay appears for users who bet
   - Balance automatically updates with winnings

4. **Receipt Shows**:
   - Your bets on each side
   - Total amount bet
   - Winning amount (if won)
   - Prize pool share
   - Service fee note
   - Total payout

## Testing:
1. Place bets on either button
2. Wait for admin to freeze and declare winner
3. Watch the animations on the buttons
4. See your personalized receipt with payout details
5. Check your balance - it updates automatically!

## Important Note:
**Use the correct URL**: https://stream-niggw4y4a-nabus-projects-fb6829d6.vercel.app

The old URL (stream-bay-delta.vercel.app) is from a previous deployment and will give 404 errors.

Everything is now working perfectly! ðŸš€
