# üîß Base Build Preview Fix

## What Was Wrong

The Base Build preview was broken because of **wallet connection conflicts**. The error message showed:
```
metamask_chainChanged - chainId: 0x2105 (Base chain)
```

This happened because:
1. The mini app was trying to connect to wallets (MetaMask)
2. Base Build preview runs in an iframe with its own wallet context
3. These two wallet contexts were conflicting

## What I Fixed

### 1. Removed Wallet Dependencies from Main Page
- Removed `useAccount` hook
- Removed wallet-based admin detection
- Simplified the streaming page to just show video

### 2. Updated Provider Configuration
- Changed `autoConnect: true` to `autoConnect: false`
- Removed wallet configuration from main provider
- Wallet features are now only in the admin panel

### 3. Added Simple Admin Access
- Small gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) in top-right corner
- Low opacity (0.3) - almost hidden
- Click it to access admin panel

## How It Works Now

**Main Page** (`/`):
- No wallet connections
- Just displays the stream
- Clean, simple, no conflicts

**Admin Page** (`/admin`):
- Wallet connection only when needed
- Protected by wallet address check
- Isolated from main streaming view

## Testing in Base Build

1. Go to [base.dev](https://base.dev)
2. Import/preview your mini app
3. The stream should display without wallet errors
4. Click the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) to access admin

## Key Principle

**Mini apps should minimize wallet interactions** on the main view. Only use wallet features when absolutely necessary (like admin panels) to avoid conflicts with the Base app's own wallet context.

## The Fix in Code

Before:
```typescript
// Main page tried to use wallet
const { address } = useAccount();
const isAdmin = address?.toLowerCase() === ADMIN_WALLET.toLowerCase();
```

After:
```typescript
// Main page has no wallet dependencies
// Just shows the stream content
```

This makes the mini app much more compatible with the Base Build preview environment!
