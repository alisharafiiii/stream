# ✅ All Issues Fixed & Deployed!

## 💰 Balance Fixes Completed

### 1. **Double $$ Sign Fixed**
- **Problem**: Admin panel showed `$$10.00` instead of `$10.00`
- **Fixed in**: `app/admin/page.tsx` line 943
- **Cause**: `formatAmount()` already adds `$`, but template had extra `$`

### 2. **All Balances Cleared**
- **Result**: 15 users had their balances reset to $0
- **Script**: `scripts/clear-all-balances.js`
- **Users affected**:
  - Wallet users with fake $10 deposits
  - Some users with small amounts (Pouya: $0.01, $epehr: $0.02, etc.)
  - nabu.base.eth: $0.58 → $0
  - Navid: $10.99 → $0
- **Total cleared**: ~$74

## 🖼️ Neynar API Status

### ✅ API Key Added
You added: `AE9247C3-7112-4923-836C-621E7AE4417D`

### 📍 Where It's Used:
1. **New User Signup** (`/api/user/route.ts`):
   - Fetches real profile when user first connects
   - Gets username, display name, and profile picture

2. **Authentication** (`/api/auth/route.ts`):
   - Fetches profile during Base app authentication

3. **Admin Panel** (`/api/users/route.ts`):
   - Batch fetches all user profiles
   - Updates with latest usernames and pictures

### 🎯 What Should Happen Now:
- **New users**: Will get real Farcaster profiles
- **Existing users**: Admin panel will show real names/pictures
- **Profile pictures**: Will load from Farcaster instead of placeholders

### ⚡ Note:
The API is configured to fall back to placeholder data if:
- API key is missing (not your case)
- API is down
- User not found on Farcaster

## 📱 What's Live Now:
1. **No double $$** in admin panel
2. **All users at $0** - clean slate
3. **Neynar API active** - real profiles loading

## 🔍 To Verify Neynar is Working:
1. Have a new user sign up
2. Check admin panel - should show real usernames
3. Profile pictures should be from Farcaster

The app is fully deployed with all fixes! 🚀
