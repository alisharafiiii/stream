**Regular Wallet (What We Built):**
```
✅ Works immediately
✅ No audit needed ($0 vs $20,000)

```

**Smart Contract (Overkill):**
```
❌ Takes weeks to build

❌ Unnecessary for <$100k volume
```

## 💡 The Truth About Payments:

**Your bank** doesn't use blockchain - just a database
**PayPal** doesn't use smart contracts - just a database
