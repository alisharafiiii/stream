# ðŸš¨ Base App URL Issue - Solution Guide

## Problem:
The Base app is having trouble with the long Vercel deployment URL because the `minikit.config.ts` has the OLD domain hardcoded.

## Current Issue:
```typescript
// Line 14 in minikit.config.ts
payload: "eyJkb21haW4iOiJzdHJlYW0tYmF5LWRlbHRhLnZlcmNlbC5hcHAifQ",
```

This decodes to: `{"domain":"stream-bay-delta.vercel.app"}` (OLD DOMAIN)

## Solutions:

### Option 1: Set Up a Custom Domain (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to your Vercel Dashboard
2. Add a custom domain like `stream.yourname.com`
3. Update DNS settings
4. Use the custom domain everywhere

### Option 2: Use Vercel Project URL
Instead of deployment-specific URLs, use your project URL:
- Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Settings
- Find your project domain (usually: `stream.vercel.app`)
- This URL stays constant across deployments

### Option 3: Test in Browser First
While we fix the Base app issue:
1. Test in regular browser: https://stream-qp0g5j3x8-nabus-projects-fb6829d6.vercel.app
2. All features work perfectly there
3. Fix the Base app configuration after

## To Fix minikit.config.ts:

You'll need to regenerate the account association with the correct domain. This requires:
1. The new domain
2. Regenerating the signature
3. Updating the payload

## Temporary Workaround:
The app works perfectly in:
- Chrome/Safari/Firefox on desktop
- Mobile browsers
- Just not in the Base app due to the domain mismatch

## Next Steps:
1. **For immediate testing**: Use the browser version
2. **For Base app**: Set up a custom domain or use project URL
3. **Update minikit.config.ts** with the new domain

The betting features, animations, and receipts all work perfectly - it's just a Base app configuration issue!
