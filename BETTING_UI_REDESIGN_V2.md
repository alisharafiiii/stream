# 🎲 Betting Interface Redesign V2 Complete!

## 🎯 New UI/UX Features

### 💰 Prize Pool Display
- **Large pixel font** (2.5rem) with 💰 emoji
- **Centered and prominent** placement
- Side pools shown in their respective colors:
  - **Purple** for X (LEFT) pool amount
  - **Blue** for O (RIGHT) pool amount
- Clear visual hierarchy

### 🎮 Betting Buttons
**Initial State:**
- Two solid color buttons:
  - **X Button**: Solid purple with engraved white "X"
  - **O Button**: Solid blue with engraved white "O"
- 3D shadow effect for depth
- Shows user's current bet amount if any

**Expanded State (when clicked):**
- Button becomes **outlined** (transparent with colored border)
- Reveals betting controls below:
  - **Amount input field** (outlined style)
  - **Preset buttons**: 10%, 25%, 50%, MAX
  - **Confirm button**: "BET X" or "BET O"
- All in matching color theme (purple for X, blue for O)

### 🎨 Visual Design
- **No betting field initially** - cleaner interface
- **Color-coded expansion** - purple theme for X, blue theme for O
- **3D button effect** with inset shadows
- **Smooth animations** for all interactions
- **Pixel font** throughout for retro feel

### 📱 Improved UX Flow
1. User sees prize pool and side amounts clearly
2. Clicks either X or O button
3. Button expands to show betting controls
4. User can:
   - Enter custom amount
   - Use preset percentage buttons (10%, 25%, 50%, MAX)
   - Confirm bet
5. After betting, button shows their bet amount

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- **Percentage-based presets** calculate from user's max bet ($10 or balance)
- **One-click expansion** - no need for separate input field
- **Color consistency** - each side maintains its theme
- **Better visual feedback** - clear active/hover states
- **Responsive design** - works on all screen sizes

## 📸 What You'll See

### Default View:
```
        💰 $125.50
    $75.25 X   O $50.25
    
    [  X  ]    [  O  ]
```

### When X is clicked:
```
        💰 $125.50
