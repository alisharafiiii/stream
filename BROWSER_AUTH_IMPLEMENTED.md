# Browser Authentication Implemented

## Overview
The app now detects whether it's running in the Base app or a regular browser and provides appropriate authentication methods for each environment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Universal Authentication Hook
Created `useUniversalAuth.ts` that:
- Detects if running in Base app vs browser
- Provides MiniKit auth for Base app users
- Provides mock auth for browser testing
- Browser users get demo accounts with:
  - Random generated FID
  - Test username and display name
  - $10 starting balance for testing

### 2. Browser Detection
The app detects Base app environment by checking:
- MiniKit context availability
- User agent string for "base" or "coinbase"
- Window object for Base-specific properties

### 3. Updated UI
- **In Base App**: Shows "Connect with Base" button
- **In Browser**: Shows "Continue as Guest" button
- Different hint messages for each environment
- Payment buttons show "(Demo)" suffix in browser

### 4. Demo Features for Browser
- Mock authentication creates test user profiles
- Demo users start with $10 balance
- Simulated payments in browser (no real transactions)
- Full betting functionality for testing

## How It Works

### In Base App:
1. User clicks "Connect with Base"
2. Base app authentication modal appears
3. Real Farcaster profile is used
4. Base Pay is available for real payments

### In Browser:
1. User clicks "Continue as Guest"
2. Mock profile is generated instantly
3. User starts with $10 demo balance
4. Can test all features without Base app

## Testing
You can now access the app from:
- **Base App**: Full functionality with real auth and payments
- **Web Browser**: Demo mode for testing all features
