# üîç Debug Guide: Why Betting Overlay Isn't Showing

## Latest Deployment with Debug Logs:
**https://stream-eedug3qzc-nabus-projects-fb6829d6.vercel.app**

## Debug Steps:

### 1. Check Last Betting Session
After you resolve a betting round, check this endpoint:
```
https://stream-eedug3qzc-nabus-projects-fb6829d6.vercel.app/api/debug/last-session
```

This will show:
- Session status (should be "resolved")
- Winner (should be "left" or "right")
- All bets placed
- Pool amounts

### 2. Open Browser Console (F12)
Look for these debug messages:

```
[BettingCard Debug] Session check: {
  sessionExists: true,
  status: "resolved",
  winner: "left",
  shouldShowResult: true
}

[BettingCard Debug] User bet totals: {
  totalUserBet: 0.25,
  leftAmount: 0.10,
  rightAmount: 0.15
}

[BettingCard Debug] SETTING SHOW RESULT TO TRUE

[BettingCard Debug] Main render: {
  showResult: true,
  sessionStatus: "resolved",
  sessionWinner: "left"
}
```

### 3. Common Issues:

#### Issue 1: No User Bets
If `totalUserBet` is 0, the overlay won't show. You must place bets before the round ends!

#### Issue 2: Wrong URL
Make sure you're using the latest deployment URL, not an old one.

#### Issue 3: Session Not Resolved Properly
Check if the session has a `winner` field. If not, the admin didn't click "Left Wins" or "Right Wins" properly.

### 4. Testing Flow:

1. **Admin**: Create a new betting session
2. **User**: Place bets on either button (LEFT or RIGHT)
3. **User**: Note your bet amounts
4. **Admin**: Click "Freeze" 
5. **Admin**: Click "Left Wins" or "Right Wins"
6. **User**: Should see overlay immediately

### 5. What You Should See:

- **Winner Button**: Pulses with green glow
- **Loser Button**: Fades to 30% opacity
- **Receipt Overlay**: Shows your bets, whether you won/lost, and payout

### 6. Check Console Errors
Any red errors in console? Those might be blocking the overlay.

## The Overlay IS in the Code!

The overlay JSX is here in BettingCard.tsx:
```jsx
{showResult && session && session.winner && (
  <div className={styles.resultOverlay}>
    // Full receipt with animations
  </div>
)}
```

It will only show if:
1. `showResult` is true
2. `session` exists
3. `session.winner` is set
4. You placed bets (totalUserBet > 0)
