# ðŸŽ¯ Final Solution: Base App URL Access

## âœ… USE THIS URL IN BASE APP:
# **https://stream-bay-delta.vercel.app**

This is your **stable project URL** that:
- Always points to your latest deployment
- Matches the domain in `minikit.config.ts`
- Should work properly in Base app

## Why This Should Work:

1. **Configuration is Correct**:
   ```javascript
   // minikit.config.ts payload decodes to:
   {"domain":"stream-bay-delta.vercel.app"}
   ```

2. **Headers are Set**:
   - `X-Frame-Options: ALLOWALL` âœ…
   - `frame-ancestors *` âœ…
   - Allows embedding in Base app

3. **It's the Official Project URL**:
   - Not a deployment-specific URL
   - Stable across all deployments
   - Listed in `vercel project ls`

## If Base App Still Won't Open:

### Quick Fixes:
1. **Force refresh** in Base app (pull down to refresh)
2. **Clear Base app cache** (Settings â†’ Clear Cache)
3. **Try opening via Farcaster frame** instead of direct URL

### Alternative Access:
- **In ANY Browser**: https://stream-qp0g5j3x8-nabus-projects-fb6829d6.vercel.app
- Works on mobile Safari, Chrome, etc.
- All features working perfectly

## Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Open https://stream-bay-delta.vercel.app in Base app
- [ ] If fails, try in mobile browser
- [ ] Connect wallet/sign in
- [ ] Place test bets
- [ ] See animations and receipts

## Remember:
- The long URLs (stream-qp0g5j3x8-...) are deployment-specific
- The short URL (stream-bay-delta) is your stable project URL
- Both point to the same app with all features working

**TL;DR**: Use https://stream-bay-delta.vercel.app in Base app!
