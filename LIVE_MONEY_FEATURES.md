## 📋 Complete Setup Guide (20 Minutes):

### Step 1: Generate Treasury Wallet
```bash
node -e "const { ethers } = require('ethers'); const w = ethers.Wallet.createRandom(); console.log('Address:', w.address); console.log('Private Key:', w.privateKey);"
```

### Step 2: Import to MetaMask
- Import using private key
- Add Base network
- You now control the treasury

### Step 3: Add to Vercel
Go to Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables:

NEXT_PUBLIC_TREASURY_ADDRESS = your_address
BASE_TESTNET = false
```

### Step 4: Fund Your Wallet
Send to your treasury address on Base network:
- **0.01 ETH** ($25) - For gas fees
- **50 USDC** - For test withdrawals

### Step 5: Deploy
```bash
vercel --prod
```
