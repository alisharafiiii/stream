## Common Issues & Solutions:

### Issue: "No animations or receipt showing"
**Solution**: 
1. Make sure you're using the CORRECT URL (not the old one)
2. Check console for errors - if you see 404 errors, you're on wrong URL
3. Ensure you actually placed bets before the round ended

### Issue: "Balance not updating"
**Solution**: 
- Balance updates automatically after:
  - Placing a bet (immediate)
  - Receiving payout (2 second delay)
- Check console for any errors

### Issue: "Bettor count seems wrong"
**Solution**: 
- The count shows UNIQUE users, not total bets
- If you bet 3 times, you still count as 1 bettor
- Each side shows how many different users bet on it

## Mobile Testing:
1. The betting card is responsive
2. On small screens:
   - Buttons are smaller
   - Bet options appear at bottom of screen
   - Font sizes adjust automatically

‚úÖ Stream persistence

Remember: Always use the latest deployment URL, not old bookmarks!
