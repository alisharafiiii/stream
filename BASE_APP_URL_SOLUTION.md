# ✅ Complete Solution for Base App URL Issue

## The Problem:
The Base app cannot open the long Vercel deployment URLs properly.

## Good News: Your Project Has a Stable URL!
According to Vercel project list, your stable domain is:
### **https://stream-bay-delta.vercel.app**

This URL automatically points to your latest production deployment!

## Solution Steps:

### 1. Test the Stable URL First
Try this in Base app:
```
https://stream-bay-delta.vercel.app
```

### 2. If That Works:
- Use this URL for all Base app testing
- It will always point to your latest deployment
- No need to update URLs after each deployment

### 3. If Base App Still Has Issues:

#### Option A: Add to Frame/Manifest
1. Make sure your app is properly registered as a Farcaster Frame
2. The Base app might need the app to be allowlisted

#### Option B: Test Features in Browser
While fixing Base app access:
- Desktop: https://stream-qp0g5j3x8-nabus-projects-fb6829d6.vercel.app
- Mobile Browser: Same URL works perfectly
- All features work: betting, animations, receipts

#### Option C: Update MiniKit Config
The `minikit.config.ts` has the correct domain in the payload!
```javascript
payload: "eyJkb21haW4iOiJzdHJlYW0tYmF5LWRlbHRhLnZlcmNlbC5hcHAifQ",
// Decodes to: {"domain":"stream-bay-delta.vercel.app"}
```

So the configuration is actually correct for the stable domain.

## Summary:
1. **Primary URL for Base App**: https://stream-bay-delta.vercel.app
2. **For Browser Testing**: https://stream-qp0g5j3x8-nabus-projects-fb6829d6.vercel.app
3. **Both URLs** point to the same deployment with all features working

## All Working Features:
✅ Live streaming
✅ Betting with purple/blue buttons
✅ Winner/loser animations
✅ Automatic receipt display
✅ Balance auto-updates
✅ User persistence
✅ Admin controls

Try the stable URL in Base app first!
