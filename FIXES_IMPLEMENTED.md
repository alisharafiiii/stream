# Fixes Implemented

All three issues have been addressed and deployed! ðŸš€

## 1. âœ… Betting Buttons Debug
Added extensive console logging to help identify the issue:
- Open browser console (F12) to see debug logs
- Look for `[BettingCard]` and `[API/betting/place]` logs
- Common issues to check:
  - **No active betting session**: Admin needs to create one from /admin
  - **User not found**: User needs to re-authenticate
  - **Insufficient balance**: User balance is too low

### Debug Endpoints:
- `/api/debug/betting?userId=YOUR_FID` - Check current session and user status
- `/api/debug/redis` - Check Redis connection

### How to Test:
1. Make sure a betting session is active (check admin panel)
2. Open browser console
3. Click purple/blue button
4. Watch console for any errors

## 2. âœ… Stream Sound Enabled
- Changed `mute=1` to `mute=0` in the YouTube embed
- Stream should now play with sound
- Note: Some browsers may still require user interaction to play audio

## 3. âœ… Offline Video Fallback
- Created `OfflineVideo` component with blurred background
- Shows when stream is offline
- Features:
  - Blurred video playing in loop
  - "Stream Offline" message overlay
  - Modern design with glassmorphism effect

## Next Steps:
1. Check browser console for betting debug logs
2. Make sure betting session is created in admin panel
3. Test with a small bet amount ($0.10)
4. Let me know what errors you see in the console!
