# Live Betting Platform - Implementation Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

### For You (The Streamer/Admin):
1. **Start a betting round**: Click "New Bet" in admin panel
2. **Set the question**: "Is the next car's plate even or odd?"
3. **Go live**: Show the action on your YouTube stream
4. **Close betting**: When ready, disable the buttons
5. **Declare winner**: Pick which option won
6. **Auto-payout**: System handles everything (takes 21% fee)

### For Your Viewers:
1. **Watch your stream** in the miniapp
2. **See betting question** appear with two buttons
3. **Place bet**: Choose left (odd) or right (even)
4. **Wait for result**: Watch the live action
5. **Get paid**: Winners receive proportional payout

## ðŸ’° Money Flow Example

**Scenario**: 10 people bet on car plate (even/odd)
- 4 people bet $10 each on ODD (left) = $40
- 6 people bet $10 each on EVEN (right) = $60
- **Total pool**: $100

**Result**: The plate is ODD (left wins!)
1. **Service fee**: $100 Ã— 21% = $21 (goes to your wallet)
2. **Winners pool**: $100 - $21 = $79
3. **Payouts**: Each winner gets their share
   - If you bet $10 on odd, you get: ($10/$40) Ã— $79 = $19.75
   - You profit $9.75 on your $10 bet!
