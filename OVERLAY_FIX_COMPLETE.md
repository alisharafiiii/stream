# ðŸŽ‰ FIXED: Betting Overlay Now Shows!

## What Was Wrong:

The overlay WAS trying to show (I saw `SETTING SHOW RESULT TO TRUE` in your logs), but it was being **immediately hidden** because:

1. When admin declares a winner, the session is marked as "resolved"
2. The backend was **deleting the session** from the database immediately
3. The BettingCard polls every 2 seconds for updates
4. When it tried to fetch the session, it got a 404 error
5. The 404 error caused it to clear the session state
6. This hid the overlay before you could see it!

## The Fix:

I made 3 changes:

### 1. Keep Resolved Sessions Available
```typescript
// Don't clear current session here - let it be replaced when a new session is created
// This allows users to see the resolved session results
```
The session now stays in the database until a new one is created.

### 2. Don't Clear Session When Showing Results
```typescript
} else if (sessionRes.status === 404) {
  // Don't clear session if we're showing results
  if (!showResult) {
    setSession(null);
  }
}
```
If the overlay is showing, we ignore 404 errors.

### 3. Don't Poll While Showing Results
```typescript
const interval = setInterval(() => {
  // Don't poll if we're showing results (to avoid clearing the overlay)
  if (!showResult) {
    fetchSessionData();
  }
}, 2000);
```
This prevents the polling from interfering with the overlay.

### Testing Steps:
1. Place bets as a user
2. Admin: Freeze the session

4. **You should now see:**
   - âœ… Winner button pulses green
   - âœ… Loser button fades
   - âœ… Full-screen overlay with your results
   - âœ… Balance updates automatically

The overlay will stay visible until you click "Continue"!
