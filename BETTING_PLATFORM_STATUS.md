## 🚧 What Still Needs Implementation

### 1. Main UI Betting Interface
The betting buttons and display for users:
```typescript
// Needs to be added to app/page.tsx:
- Betting card showing current question
- Two betting buttons (Left/Right)
- Bet amount input
- Real-time pool display
- User's current bets display
```

### 2. Deposit/Withdrawal System
Currently uses internal balances:
- ⏳ Deposit funds via Base Pay
- ⏳ Withdraw balance to wallet
- ⏳ Transaction history

## 📋 How to Complete the Implementation

### Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables
Create `.env.local` with:
```env
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://lucky-kangaroo-5978.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=ARdaAAImcDJmNTY0NmViMTU2MWI0MmEwOWU0OTczMzBjNzQ1NjllN3AyNTk3OA
ADMIN_WALLET=0xAbD4BB1Ba7C9a57C40598604A7ad0E5d105AD54D
```

### Step 2: Test the System
1. Go to `/admin` and connect your admin wallet
2. Create a betting session
3. Open another browser/incognito to test user betting
4. Freeze betting and declare a winner
5. Check that payouts are processed correctly

### Step 3: Add Betting UI to Main Page
The main page needs betting components added. Would you like me to:
1. Create a betting component for the main page?
2. Add deposit/withdrawal features?
3. Create a user betting history page?

## 💰 How the Money Flow Works

1. **Users have internal balances** (not direct wallet transactions)
2. **Betting deducts from balance** (no gas fees)
3. **Winners receive proportional payouts** to their balance
4. **21% service fee** goes to admin
5. **Future: Add withdrawal system** to cash out balances

## 🎯 Quick Start Guide

1. **As Admin**:
   - Go to `/admin`
   - Create a betting question
   - Monitor bets in real-time
   - Freeze and declare winner

2. **As User**:
   - Currently need to manually test API endpoints
   - Main UI implementation pending

## Important Notes

- **Payouts are to user balances**, not directly to wallets
- **Multiple bets allowed** - users can bet multiple times
- **Redis stores everything** - betting data persists
- **Admin controls are secure** - wallet verification required

Let me know if you'd like me to implement the main UI betting interface!
