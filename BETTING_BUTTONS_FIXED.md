# 🎯 Betting Buttons Fixed & User Data Storage Confirmed

## 1. Fixed Betting Button Expansion ✅

**Problem**: The blue and purple buttons weren't expanding when clicked.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed CSS issue where `buttonIndicator` div was intercepting clicks
- Added `pointer-events: none` to the indicator overlay
- Added debug logging to track button interactions

**How it works now**:
1. Click purple (left) or blue (right) button
2. Button expands showing:
   - 6 preset amounts: $0.10, $0.25, $0.50, $1.00, $2.50, $5.00
   - Custom amount input field
   - "Bet" button to confirm
3. Click again to collapse

## 2. User Data IS Being Saved! ✅

### What We Store in Redis:

**User Profile** (`user:profile:{fid}`):
- Farcaster ID (unique identifier)
- Username & Display Name
- Profile Image URL
- Current Balance
- Created timestamp
- Last seen timestamp

**Betting Statistics** (`user:betting:stats:{fid}`):
- Total betting sessions participated
- Wins vs Losses count
- Total amount wagered
- Total winnings
- Net profit/loss

**Individual Bets** (`betting:bets:{sessionId}:{userId}`):
- Each bet placed per session
- Amount on left/right
- All transactions with timestamps

### New User Benefits:
- **$10 Starting Balance** - All new users get $10 to start betting
- **Persistent Profile** - No need to re-register
- **Balance Carries Over** - Between sessions
- **Complete History** - All bets tracked

## 3. Testing the Fix

1. **Check Browser Console** (F12) for debug logs:
   - `[BettingCard] Session: ...`
   - `[BettingCard] User balance: ...`
   - `[BettingCard] Can bet: ...`
   - `[BettingCard] Left button clicked...`

2. **Button Should Now**:
   - Respond to clicks
   - Expand/collapse properly
   - Show betting options
   - Process bets correctly

## 4. User Flow

### First Time User:
1. Connect with Farcaster
2. Profile auto-created with $10 balance
3. Data saved to Redis
4. Ready to bet immediately

### Returning User:
1. Connect with Farcaster
2. Profile loaded from Redis
3. Balance and history preserved
4. Continue where they left off

## Troubleshooting

If buttons still don't work:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
2. Check if betting session exists
3. Verify balance > 0
4. Ensure Redis environment variables are set

The deployment is live with all fixes! 🚀
