# ✅ All Issues Fixed!

## 1. Fixed Footer Buttons Issue 🎮
**Problem**: The purple and blue buttons in the footer were deducting $0.01 from balance but not connected to the betting system.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the old footer overlay buttons from StreamOverlay component
- These were legacy gift/chat buttons that predated the betting system
- Now only the BettingCard buttons handle bets properly

## 2. Fixed Admin Panel Input Colors 🎨
**Problem**: Input text was white on white background, making it invisible.

**Solution**:
- Updated CSS to set input text color to black (#000)
- Set input background to white (#fff)
- Now all form inputs in admin panel are clearly visible

## 3. Added Delete Button for Sessions 🗑️
**Problem**: No way to delete old betting sessions.

**Solution**:
- Added delete functionality in betting service
- Delete button appears on resolved sessions in history
- Confirms before deletion to prevent accidents
- Only resolved sessions can be deleted

## 4. Added Betting History Display 📜
**Problem**: No way to view previous betting sessions.

**Solution**:
- Added "Show History" button in admin panel
- Displays up to 20 recent sessions
- Shows question, pools, winner, and service fees
- Each resolved session has a delete button
