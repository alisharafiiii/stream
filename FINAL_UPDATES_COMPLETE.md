## 🖼️ Profile Pictures Fixed
- **Issue**: Admin panel was trying to fetch from paid Neynar API on every load
- **Solution**: Modified `/api/users` to serve already-updated profiles from Redis
- **Result**: 50 users already have real profile pictures from our batch update

## 💰 Service Fee Updated to 6.9%
Changed from 21% → 6.9% in all locations:

### Code Changes:
1. **lib/betting-service.ts**: `SERVICE_FEE_PERCENT = 6.9`
2. **app/admin/page.tsx**: 
   - "Expected Service Fee (6.9%)"
   - Service fee calculations
   - Instructions text
3. **app/components/BettingCard.tsx**:
   - Receipt shows "Service Fee (6.9%)"
   - Calculations use 0.069
4. **app/api/user/history/[fid]/route.ts**:
   - Fallback service fee changed to 6.9

### What This Means:
- Winners now get 2x their bet minus 6.9% (instead of 21%)
- Example: Bet $10 → Win $20 - $1.38 fee = **$18.62 payout**
- Previous: Bet $10 → Win $20 - $4.20 fee = $15.80 payout
- **Users keep $2.82 more per $10 bet!**
