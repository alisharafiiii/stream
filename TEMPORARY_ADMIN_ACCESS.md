# ⚠️ TEMPORARY ADMIN ACCESS ENABLED ⚠️

## What I Did:
I've temporarily enabled admin access for ALL wallets so you can test immediately.

## IMPORTANT SECURITY WARNING:
This is NOT secure for production! Anyone can access your admin panel right now.

## How to Fix Properly:

### Step 1: Get Your Full Wallet Address
1. Connect to the admin panel: https://stream-40w88q9b5-nabus-projects-fb6829d6.vercel.app/admin
2. You'll see a debug box showing your full wallet address
3. Copy that address

### Step 2: Update Environment Variable in Vercel
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com)
2. Select your `stream` project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Update `ADMIN_WALLET` to your full wallet address
5. Save and redeploy

### Step 3: Remove Temporary Access
After setting up your wallet properly, update line 84 in `/app/admin/page.tsx`:
```typescript
// Change from:
const isAdmin = true;

// Back to:
const isAdmin = address ? ADMIN_WALLETS.includes(address.toLowerCase()) : false;
```

## Use Latest URL:
### Admin: https://stream-40w88q9b5-nabus-projects-fb6829d6.vercel.app/admin
### App: https://stream-40w88q9b5-nabus-projects-fb6829d6.vercel.app

The betting overlay animations are fixed in this version!
