# üéâ Betting UI Integration Complete!

## What's New

The betting interface is now fully integrated into your miniapp! Users can now see and interact with betting sessions directly below the video stream.

## Features Added

### For Users:
- **Betting Card** below the video stream showing:
  - Current betting question
  - Total pool amount
  - Live distribution between left/right options
  - Number of bettors on each side
  - Real-time updates every 2 seconds
  
- **Betting Controls**:
  - Bet amount input (default $0.10)
  - Two betting buttons (Left/Odd and Right/Even)
  - Multiple bets allowed per round
  - Shows user's current bets
  
- **Status Indicators**:
  - üî¥ Live Betting - when betting is open
  - üîí Betting Frozen - when admin freezes betting
  - ‚è≥ Waiting for results - after betting is frozen

### How It Works:

1. **Admin creates a betting session** in /admin panel
2. **Users see the betting card** appear below the video
3. **Users can bet multiple times** on either or both options
4. **Real-time updates** show pool growth and bet distribution
5. **Admin freezes betting** when ready
6. **Betting buttons disable** automatically when frozen
7. **Admin declares winner** and payouts are processed

## Testing Instructions

### As Admin:
1. Go to https://stream-bay-delta.vercel.app/admin
2. Scroll down to "Live Betting Management"
3. Create a new betting session (e.g., "Is the next car's plate even or odd?")
4. Watch the bets come in
5. Click "Freeze Betting" when ready
6. Declare the winner

### As User:
1. Go to https://stream-bay-delta.vercel.app
2. Sign in with Farcaster
3. Look below the video for the betting card
4. Enter bet amount and click Left or Right
5. You can bet multiple times!

## Important: Environment Variables

**The betting features won't work until you add these to Vercel:**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/nabus-projects-fb6829d6/stream/settings/environment-variables
2. Add these variables:
   ```
   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://lucky-kangaroo-5978.upstash.io
   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=ARdaAAImcDJmNTY0NmViMTU2MWI0MmEwOWU0OTczMzBjNzQ1NjllN3AyNTk3OA
   ADMIN_WALLET=0xAbD4BB1Ba7C9a57C40598604A7ad0E5d105AD54D
   ```
3. Click "Save" for each
4. **Redeploy** from Vercel dashboard

## Troubleshooting

If betting card shows "Loading..." forever:
- Environment variables not set in Vercel
- Redis connection issue

If betting buttons don't disable when frozen:
- Clear browser cache and refresh
- Check that you're using the latest deployment

## What's Next?

Consider adding:
- Sound effects for bets
- Winner announcement animations
- Betting history page
- Leaderboard of top bettors
- Deposit/withdrawal system

Your live betting platform is ready! üé∞
