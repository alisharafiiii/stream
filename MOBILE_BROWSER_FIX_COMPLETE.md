# Mobile Browser Fix Complete! ðŸ“±

## Issues Fixed

The header, footer, and comment button were not showing on mobile browsers. This has been fixed with the following changes:

## 1. âœ… Fixed Z-Index Hierarchy
**Problem**: Header had low z-index (20) causing it to be hidden on mobile browsers
**Solution**: 
- Increased StreamOverlay header z-index from 20 to 1050
- Set streamContainer z-index to 1 for proper stacking context
- Adjusted CommentsOverlay z-index to 1002 for visibility

## 2. âœ… Fixed Header Visibility
**Problem**: Header (StreamOverlay) only showed when user was logged in
**Solution**: 
- Header now shows even for guest users with default values
- Moved StreamOverlay outside of streamContainer for better mobile visibility
- Added solid background and full viewport width on mobile

## 3. âœ… Fixed Footer Visibility  
**Problem**: Footer was hidden when no user was logged in
**Solution**:
- CollapsedFooter now shows when either:
  - Betting deck is collapsed OR
  - No user is logged in (guest mode)
- Clicking betting button prompts login if not authenticated

## 4. âœ… Mobile Browser Optimizations
- Added viewport fixes for mobile browsers
- Ensured fixed positioning works properly on mobile
- Added `-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden` for smooth rendering
- Set proper overflow and margin/padding on body

## 5. âœ… Debug Info Added
- Added mobile browser detection logging
- Logs user agent, device type, and component states
- Helps troubleshoot future mobile issues

## How It Works Now

### For Guest Users on Mobile:
1. **Header**: Shows with "Guest" profile and $0 balance
2. **Footer**: Shows mute button and betting button
3. **Comments**: Overlay and input button are visible
4. **Betting**: Clicking betting button prompts login

### For Logged-in Users on Mobile:
1. **Header**: Shows actual profile, username, and balance
2. **Footer**: Either collapsed footer OR expanded betting deck
