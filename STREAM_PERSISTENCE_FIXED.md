# âœ… Stream Configuration Now Persists!

## Problem Fixed

The stream was going back to "offline" after refresh because the configuration was stored in memory (global variable) which resets when the serverless function restarts. On Vercel, this happens frequently.

## Solution

I've updated the stream configuration to use **Redis storage** instead of memory. Now your stream settings persist permanently!

### What Changed:

1. **Removed** memory-based storage (global variable)
2. **Removed** local JSON file (`data/stream-config.json`)
3. **Added** Redis storage for stream configuration
4. **Result**: Stream status persists across refreshes and deployments

### How It Works Now:

1. **When you set stream to "Live"**:
   - Configuration saves to Redis database
   - Persists permanently until you change it
   - Survives server restarts and deployments

2. **When page refreshes**:
   - Loads configuration from Redis
   - Maintains your last saved state
   - No more resetting to offline!

## Testing the Fix

1. Go to `/admin`
2. Set your stream URL
3. Click "Go Live"
4. Save configuration
5. Refresh the page multiple times
6. **Stream should stay LIVE! âœ…**

## Benefits

- âœ… Stream status persists between sessions
- âœ… No more losing configuration on refresh
- âœ… Works across all server instances
- âœ… Survives deployments and restarts
- âœ… Same reliable storage as betting data

## Important Note

Make sure your Redis environment variables are set in Vercel:
```
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://lucky-kangaroo-5978.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=ARdaAAImcDJmNTY0NmViMTU2MWI0MmEwOWU0OTczMzBjNzQ1NjllN3AyNTk3OA
```

Your stream configuration will now persist properly! ðŸš€
