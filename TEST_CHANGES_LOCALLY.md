# Test Changes Locally First

The issue is that Vercel appears to be deploying from a Git repository or cached source, not from your local files.

## To See The Changes I Made:

### 1. Test Locally First
```bash
# The dev server is already running
open http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. What Changes Are Actually Made:

#### Toggle Button (35x35px):
```bash
grep "width: 35px" app/components/BettingCard.module.css
# Output: 103:  width: 35px;
```

#### Retro Gaming Overlay:
```bash
grep "pixelWin" app/components/BettingCard.module.css
# Output shows the animation exists
```

#### Balance Modal Fix:
```bash
grep "\.overlay {" app/components/BalanceModal.module.css
# Shows the CSS class is fixed
```

## The Problem:

1. I've been editing YOUR LOCAL FILES
2. Vercel is deploying from SOMEWHERE ELSE (likely a Git repo)
3. That's why you don't see changes at https://stream-bay-delta.vercel.app

## Solutions:

### Option 1: Push to Git
If this project is in Git:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Add retro gaming overlay and fix toggle button"
git push
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
Upload the files manually to Vercel dashboard

### Option 3: Test Locally
The changes ARE working on localhost:3000

## What I Actually Changed:

1. **app/components/BettingCard.module.css**
   - Toggle button: 35x35px (line 103)
   - Retro animations: pixelWin, pixelLose, pixelPulse
   - Full-screen overlay styling

2. **app/components/BalanceModal.module.css**
   - Fixed class name from .modalOverlay to .overlay

3. **app/api/user/history/[fid]/route.ts**
   - Added try-catch for withdrawal parsing

All these changes are IN YOUR LOCAL FILES but not reaching Vercel's deployment.
