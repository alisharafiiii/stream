# ðŸ”§ Base App Preview Fix

## The Issue:
You're using `https://stream-5xcich9ta-nabus-projects-fb6829d6.vercel.app` but Base app expects the configured domain.

## âœ… THE SOLUTION - Use This URL:
# https://stream-bay-delta.vercel.app

This is your STABLE domain that:
- Always points to your latest deployment
- Is configured in your minikit.config.ts
- Works properly with Base app

## Why Other URLs Don't Work:
1. Your minikit.config.ts has `stream-bay-delta.vercel.app` hardcoded
2. Base app validates the domain against the manifest
3. Deployment-specific URLs like `stream-5xcich9ta-...` won't match

## Quick Test:
1. Open Base app
2. Go to: **https://stream-bay-delta.vercel.app**
3. Everything should work! 

## For Admin Panel in Base App:
**https://stream-bay-delta.vercel.app/admin**

## All Your New Features Are There:
- âœ… Withdraw functionality (click balance)
- âœ… Retro black/neon green style
- âœ… X and O buttons
- âœ… Mobile optimized UI
- âœ… All betting features

## If You Still Have Issues:
The problem might be the iframe headers. I already configured them in next.config.ts, but if Base app still complains, we may need to adjust the Content Security Policy.

**But first, try the stable URL!**
