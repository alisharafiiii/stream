# ðŸ”„ What Changed to Make Deposits Real

## Before (Demo Mode):
```javascript
// Just credited fake balance
const response = await fetch('/api/user', {
  body: JSON.stringify({
    amount: amount,
    transactionId: `demo-${Date.now()}`,
  })
});
```

## After (Real Money):

### For Base App:
```javascript
// Opens Base Pay - users pay real USDC
const payment = await pay({
  amount: amount.toFixed(2),
  to: YOUR_TREASURY_ADDRESS, // Real wallet!
});
```

### For Browser:
```javascript
// Connects MetaMask - sends real USDC
const txHash = await ethereum.request({
  method: 'eth_sendTransaction',
  params: [{
    to: USDC_CONTRACT,
    data: transferFunction(treasuryAddress, amount)
  }]
});
```

## Key Changes:

1. **Added Treasury Wallet**
   - Real wallet address that receives funds
   - Private key stored securely in Vercel

2. **USDC Integration**
   - Uses USDC stablecoin (1 USDC = $1)
   - Contract: `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`
   - 6 decimal places

3. **Base Pay Integration**
   - Users see payment screen
   - Can pay with USDC, ETH, or card
   - Goes directly to your treasury

4. **MetaMask Support**
   - For browser users
   - Sends USDC from their wallet
   - Same treasury destination

5. **Withdrawal Service**
   - `USDCWithdrawalService` class
   - Sends real USDC from treasury
   - Checks balances before sending
   - Handles gas fees

## The Magic Line:
```javascript
// This makes it real:
to: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TREASURY_ADDRESS
```

Instead of crediting a fake balance, payments go to your real wallet!

## Files Changed:
- `/app/components/BalanceModal.tsx` - Real payment flows
- `/lib/usdc-withdrawal-service.ts` - USDC withdrawals
- `/app/api/user/withdraw-real/route.ts` - Withdrawal API
- `/app/components/TreasuryMonitor.tsx` - Shows USDC balance

## That's It! 
Just by adding a wallet address and using Base Pay, your app now handles real money. No complex smart contracts needed!
