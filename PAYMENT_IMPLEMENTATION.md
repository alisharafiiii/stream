# Payment Implementation Status

## Current Status
The payment functionality is currently **simulated** as the MiniKit payment hooks are not yet available in the current version of OnchainKit.

## What's Implemented
1. **UI/UX Flow**: Complete payment flow with amount selection ($1, $5, $10, $20, $50)
2. **Custom Amount**: Users can enter any custom amount
3. **Loading States**: "Processing..." state during payment
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for failed payments
5. **Balance Updates**: Simulated balance updates after successful payment

## Technical Details
- Payment processing is simulated with a 1.5 second delay
- Balance is updated via the `/api/user` endpoint
- User data is stored in memory (not persisted on Vercel)

## Future Integration
When MiniKit releases the `useFundWallet` hook or similar payment functionality:

1. Import the payment hook:
   ```typescript
   import { useFundWallet } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/minikit';
   ```

2. Replace the simulated payment in `handleTopup`:
   ```typescript
   const result = await openFundWallet();
   if (result) {
     // Update balance after successful payment
   }
   ```

## Current Payment Flow
1. User selects or enters amount
2. Clicks "Top Up $X"
3. App simulates payment processing (1.5s)
4. Balance is updated in user profile
5. User is redirected to the stream

## Note
The payment simulation allows testing the complete user flow while waiting for the official MiniKit payment API.
