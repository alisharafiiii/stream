# Force Base App to Refresh

The deployment is successful! Your app is now live with all the changes at:
https://stream-bay-delta.vercel.app

## To force Base app to refresh:

1. **Close the mini app completely** in Base app
2. **Force quit the Base app** (swipe up and remove from recent apps)
3. **Clear Base app cache** (if possible in app settings)
4. **Reopen Base app** and navigate to your mini app

## Alternative: Use a cache-busting URL

Try accessing your app with a timestamp parameter:
```
https://stream-bay-delta.vercel.app/?v=1729388485
```

## Verify Changes Are Live

## What Was The Issue?

Your Vercel project was connected to a GitHub repository, but you were editing local files. We bypassed the Git connection and deployed directly from your local files.
