# Debugging Stream Persistence Issue

## Let's Find the Problem

I've added debugging to help identify why your stream isn't persisting. 

### Step 1: Check Redis Connection

Please visit this URL in your browser:
```
https://stream-bay-delta.vercel.app/api/debug/redis
```

This will show:
- If Redis is connected
- If environment variables are set
- Current stream configuration in Redis

### Step 2: Check Browser Console

1. Open your main page: https://stream-bay-delta.vercel.app
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for: `[Page] Stream config from API:`
4. Share what it shows

### Step 3: After Setting Stream to Live

1. Go to `/admin`
2. Set stream to "Live" and save
3. Check the browser console for any errors
4. Visit the debug URL again to see if config was saved

### Possible Issues:

1. **Redis Environment Variables Not Set in Vercel**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Make sure these are added:
     ```
     UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://lucky-kangaroo-5978.upstash.io
     UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=ARdaAAImcDJmNTY0NmViMTU2MWI0MmEwOWU0OTczMzBjNzQ1NjllN3AyNTk3OA
     ```

2. **Redis Connection Issues**
   - The debug endpoint will show if Redis is working
   - If not connected, environment variables are missing

3. **Config Not Saving**
   - Check admin panel console for errors when saving

### What I Changed:

1. Removed the temporary override that was setting default values
2. Added proper error handling and fallbacks
3. Added debug logging to track the issue
4. Created debug endpoint to test Redis connection

Please check the debug endpoint and let me know what it shows!
