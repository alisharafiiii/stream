# Test Your Deployment NOW

Your app has been deployed to: https://stream-bay-delta.vercel.app

## How to Test:

1. Open the Base app
2. Go to your mini app
3. Open the browser console (if possible)
4. You should see: `ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT TEST: Version 2024-10-20-TEST123`
5. The LIVE indicator should show "LIVE v2" instead of just "LIVE"

## Test in Regular Browser:

Open this in your browser: https://stream-bay-delta.vercel.app
- Press F12 to open console
- Look for the deployment test message
- Check if LIVE shows as "LIVE v2"

## If you still don't see changes:

The issue is that Vercel might be caching or there's a GitHub webhook overriding our deployments.

Let me know what you see!
