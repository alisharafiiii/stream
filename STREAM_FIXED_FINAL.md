# âœ… Stream Persistence FIXED!

## The Problem Was Simple

You had to click **TWO buttons** to make it work:
1. "Go Live" â†’ Only changed the display
2. "Save Configuration" â†’ Actually saved to database

You were clicking "Go Live" but not "Save Configuration", so it never saved!

## The Fix

I made the **"Go Live" button automatically save** to the database. Now:

- Click "Go Live" â†’ Saves immediately âœ…
- Refresh page â†’ Stays live âœ…
- No need for separate save button

## How to Use Now

1. Go to `/admin`
2. Enter your stream URL
3. Click **"Go Live"** (it will show "Saving..." then change to "Stop Stream")
4. That's it! It's saved automatically
5. Refresh as many times as you want - it stays live!

## Test It

1. Check debug: https://stream-bay-delta.vercel.app/api/debug/redis
2. Look for `"isLive": true` in the streamConfig
3. Refresh your main page - stream stays live!

The deployment is complete. Your stream status will now persist properly! ðŸš€
