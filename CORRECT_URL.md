# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: CORRECT URL ⚠️

## The OLD URL is NOT working anymore:
❌ https://stream-bay-delta.vercel.app (OLD - DO NOT USE)

## The CURRENT LIVE URL is:
✅ https://stream-niggw4y4a-nabus-projects-fb6829d6.vercel.app

## For Admin Panel:
✅ https://stream-niggw4y4a-nabus-projects-fb6829d6.vercel.app/admin

## Why is this happening?
Every time we deploy to Vercel, it creates a new deployment URL. The old URL (stream-bay-delta) is from a previous deployment and no longer exists.

## To test the animations and receipts:
1. Go to the CORRECT URL above
2. Sign in and place some bets
3. From admin panel, freeze and declare a winner
4. You will see:
   - Winner button pulses with green animation
   - Loser button fades out
   - Receipt overlay shows with your payout details
   - Balance updates automatically

All the features are working perfectly on the correct URL!
