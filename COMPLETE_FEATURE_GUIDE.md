# 🚀 Complete Feature Guide - Stream Live Mini App

## ✨ New Features Added

### 1. **Engaging Preview Image**
- Enhanced frame metadata for better social sharing
- Preview shows with "🎬 Watch Live" button
- Uses `/public/hero.png` as preview image
- See `CREATE_PREVIEW_IMAGE.md` for customization guide

### 2. **User Authentication Flow**
When users open the mini app:
1. Stream starts playing automatically (fullscreen portrait)
2. Authentication modal appears over the stream
3. Users click "Connect with Base" to sign in
4. Profile is created automatically with Base app info

### 3. **User Profile System**
- Stores user data: FID, username, display name, profile image, balance
- Data persists locally (note: resets on Vercel deployments)
- API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/user` - Create/update profile
  - `GET /api/user?fid=123` - Get profile
  - `PUT /api/user` - Update balance

### 4. **Top-Up Account Feature**
After signing in:
- Users see a top-up screen
- Quick amounts: $5, $10, $20, $50
- Custom amount input
- Can skip for later
- Balance stored in user profile

### 5. **Live User Overlay**
Shows in top-right corner:
- User's profile picture
- Display name
- Current balance (💰 $XX.XX)
- Smooth slide-in animation
- Semi-transparent background

## 🎮 User Experience Flow

1. **Share mini app** → Shows cool preview with "Watch Live" button
2. **User opens** → Stream autoplays fullscreen
3. **Auth modal** → "Connect with Base" (overlaid on stream)
4. **Profile created** → Automatic with Base user data
5. **Top-up prompt** → Add funds or skip
6. **Stream view** → Shows user info overlay in corner

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Components Created:
- `/app/components/AuthModal.tsx` - Sign-in and top-up flow
- `/app/components/UserOverlay.tsx` - User info display
- `/app/api/user/route.ts` - User profile API

### Key Features:
- Stream continues playing during auth (non-blocking)
- Graceful fallbacks for missing user data
- Profile images from Dicebear API
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## 📝 Admin Features

- Hidden gear icon (⚙️) in top-right for admin access
- No wallet popups on main page (Base Build compatible)
- Admin panel remains wallet-gated

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Data Persistence
- User profiles stored in `/data/users.json`
- **Limitation**: Data resets on Vercel deployments
- **Solution**: Use database (Vercel KV, Supabase, etc.) for production

### Testing Users
In development, users get:
- Username: `userXXX` (XXX = their FID)
- Avatar: Generated from Dicebear API
- Initial balance: $0

### Preview Image
- Current: Uses `/public/hero.png`
- To customize: See `CREATE_PREVIEW_IMAGE.md`
- Best practice: 1200x630px with bold visuals
